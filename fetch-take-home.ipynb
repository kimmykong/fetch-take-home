    "This notebook acts as the client and sends requests to the server run by running <code>server.py</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook with its output is to show that the server behaves as a server and can get and send responses for the 3 specified endpoints.\n",
    "The test cases in the assignment are shown here.  Additional examples are provided in <code>unittests.py</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output given in cell 1 and cell 2 is run with my computer's IP and server.\n",
    "I will provide the same code but allow you to input your IP and port at the end should you want to run locally\n",

    "__To run this notebook__\n",
    "1. Run <code>server.py</code> (navigate to the folder that contains <code>server.py</code>  and type <code>python server.py</code>  an Anaconda Prompt).\n",
    "2. Observe the IP address of the server returned in the command prompt.\n",
    "3. Comment out cells 1 and 2\n",
    "4. Input your server's IP in cell 3. \n",
    "5. Uncomment cell 4 and run it\n",
